First steps in Swift
SwiftUI is a powerful framework for building user-interactive apps for iOS, macOS, tvOS, and even watchOS. But you can’t build software without having a 
programming language, so behind SwiftUI lies Swift itself: a powerful, flexible, and modern programming language that you’ll use for all your SwiftUI apps.

As Mark Twain once said, “the secret to getting ahead is getting started.” Well, you’re starting now, so we’re going to dive in and learn about variables, 
constants, and simple data types in Swift.

Today you have seven tutorials to complete. If you want to dive deeper into each topic there is optional further reading, but you don’t need to read that 
unless you want to and have the time. Regardless, there are a number of short tests to help make sure you’ve understood key concepts.

I know, I know: the temptation is strong to continue on to watch more videos and take more tests beyond those linked below, but remember: don’t rush ahead! 
It’s much better to do one hour a day every day than do chunks with large gaps between.



Why Swift?
There are lots of programming languages out there, but I think you’re going to really enjoy learning Swift. This is partly for practical reasons – you can 
make a lot of money on the App Store! – but there are lots of technical reasons too.

You see, Swift is a relatively young language, having launched only in 2014. This means it doesn’t have a lot of the language cruft that old languages can 
suffer from, and usually means there is only one way to solve a particular problem.

At the same time, being such a new programming language means that Swift leverages all sorts of new ideas built upon the successes – and sometimes mistakes 
– of older languages. For example, it makes it hard to accidentally write unsafe code, it makes it very easy to write code that is clear and understandable, 
and it supports all the world languages so you’ll never see those strange character errors that plague other languages.

Swift itself is just the language, and isn’t designed to draw anything on the screen. When it comes to building software with Swift, you’ll be using SwiftUI: 
Apple’s powerful framework that creates text, buttons, images, user interaction, and much more. As the name suggests, SwiftUI was built for Swift – it’s l
iterally designed to leverage the power and safety offered by the language, which makes it remarkably quick to build really powerful apps.

So, you should learn Swift because you can make a lot of money with it, but also because it does so many things really well. No cruft, no confusion, just 
lots of power at your fingertips. What’s not to like?



About this course
I’ve been teaching folks to write Swift since 2014, the same year Swift launched, and at this point Hacking with Swift is the world’s largest site 
dedicated to teaching Swift.

Along the way I learned a huge amount about what topics matter the most, how to structure topics into a smooth and consistent flow, and most importantly 
how to help learners remember topics they’ve learned. This course is the product of all that learning.

Unlike my previous work this does not strive to teach you every aspect of Swift, but instead it spends more time on the subset of features that matter the 
most – the ones you’ll use in every app you build, time and time again. Yes, there are some advanced language features covered, but I’ve cherrypicked them 
based on usefulness. When you’ve finished the book you might want to carry on learning some of the more advanced features, but I suspect you’d much rather 
get busy learning how to use SwiftUI.

Each chapter of this book is available as both text and video, but they cover exactly the same material so you’re welcome to learn whichever way suits 
you best. If you’re using the videos you’ll notice that I sometimes introduce topics using slides and sometimes demonstrate them in Xcode. It might feel 
repetitive, but it’s intentional – there’s a lot of things to learn, and if you saw each one only once it just wouldn’t stay in your memory!

There’s one last thing: you might notice how many chapters start with “How to…”, and that’s intentional – this book is here to show you how to do things 
in a hands-on way, as opposed to delving into theory. Theory is important, and you’ll come across a lot of it as you can continue to learn, but here the 
focus is relentlessly practical because I believe the best way to learn something new is to try it yourself.

Programming is an art: don't spend all your time sharpening your pencil when you should be drawing.



How to follow along
There’s a lot of code shown off in this book, and I really want to encourage you to try it all yourself – type the code into your computer, run it and see 
the output, then experiment a little to make sure you understand it.

To run the code in this book you should have installed Xcode 15.0 or later from the Mac App Store. It’s free, and includes everything you need to follow 
along.

We’ll be using a Swift Playground for all the code in this book. You can create one by launching Xcode, then going to the File menu and choosing New > 
Playground. When you’re asked what kind of playground to create, choose Blank from the macOS tab, then save it somewhere you can get to easily.

Playgrounds are like little sandboxes where you can try out Swift code easily, seeing the result of your work side by side with the code. You can use one 
playground for all the work you’ll be doing, or create new a playground for each chapter – do whatever works best for you.

Tip: The first time you run code in a playground it might take a few seconds to start, but subsequent runs will be fast.
